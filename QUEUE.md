# Queue

* A data structure which follows the principal of FIFO (First In First Out).

* A element is inserted at the back and deleted in the front.

## Basic operations

1. Enqueue - Adds an element to the back of the Queue

2. Dequeue - Remove the element from the front of the Queue

## Variations

1. Double ended Queue

* A element is inserted anddeleted from both the front and back of the Queue

2. Circular Queue

* In standard Queue, when an element is deleted, the vacant space is not reutilized. However, in a circular Queue, vacant spaces are reutilized.
