# Stack

* A linear data structure which follows the principal of LIFO (Last In First Out) / FILO (First In Last Out)

## Basic operations

1. Push - Add an element to the collection

2. Pop - Remove an element from the collection

3. Peek - Get the top most element

Note:

1. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an overflow condition

2. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an underflow condition
